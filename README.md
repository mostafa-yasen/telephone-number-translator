Many companies use telephone numbers like `555-GET-FOOD` so the number is **easier**
for their customers to remember. On a standard telephone, the alphabetic letters are
mapped to numbers in the following fashion:
```python
A, B, and C = 2
D, E, and F = 3
G, H, and I = 4
J, K, and L = 5
M, N, and O = 6
P, Q, R, and S = 7
T, U, and V = 8
W, X, Y, and Z = 9
